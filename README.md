👋 Hi there, I'm wideyard!

I love traveling, tasting delicious food, and exploring the world.

📝 About Me

I'm a passionate student majoring in Software Engineering. My research focus lies in the cutting-edge fields of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) and multimodal.

I'm obsessed with bridging academic theories and engineering practices—turning complex AI algorithms into practical, efficient systems is what drives me.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Multimodal LLM Fine-tuning Project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced Prompt Engineering & Cross-modal Retrieval
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love debugging AI models while sipping milk tea
